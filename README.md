# Captcha API
![Open Source? Yes!](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20Source%20%3F/Yes%21/blue?icon=github)

## Info
I made this API so I can use it alongside [Essentials Discord Bot](https://github.com/Ammar-sys/essentials) and I've decided to make it public. The API is live at [PythonAnywhere](https://ammarsysdev.pythonanywhere.com/). Tell us [here](https://github.com/Ammar-sys/captchaAPI/issues) if you run into issues, discord works as well. (ammar#0443)

## USAGE

### Wrappers

 - [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/essentials-captcha)
 - [Repository & Creator](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/essentials-captcha#readme)

### Manual Install
 
 Make sure to go through the files and edit paths. (both py files)
 
 To install the necessary modules for this to run do

```python
pip install requirements.txt
``` 

Incase that doesn't work, try:

```python
py -m pip install requirements.txt
```

This API is intended for discord bots (by this I mean it suits them the best, this probally isn't good for stuff like web development) but it can be used for other fields and other projects, for discord bots it should be fine

This version is a new, fast and completely rewritten API, originally by Vixen, which was discontinued.
