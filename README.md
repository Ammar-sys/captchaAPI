# Captcha API
![Open Source? Yes!](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20Source%20%3F/Yes%21/blue?icon=github)

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## Info
I made this API so I can use it alongside [Essentials Discord Bot](https://github.com/Ammar-sys/essentials) and I've decided to make it public (open source). The API is live at [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/) (specifically, https://ammarsysdev.pythonanywhere.com/). Tell us [here](https://github.com/Ammar-sys/captchaAPI/issues) if you run into issues, discord works as well. (ammar#0443)

## USAGE

### Wrappers

 - [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/essentials-captcha)
 - [Repository & Creator](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/essentials-captcha#readme)

### Manual Usage

Simply make a HTTP get request to the API endpoint and treat it like a JSON.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('ammarsysdev.pythonanywhere/api/img).json()

print(response["solution"], response["url"])
```

or, if you'd like a async request

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://ammarsysdev.pythonanywhere.com/api/img') as responseget:
            return await responseget.json()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
response = loop.run_until_complete(main())
print(response["solution"], response["url"])
```

This API is intended for discord bots (by this I mean it suits them the best, this probally isn't good for stuff like web development) but it can be used for other fields and other projects, for discord bots it should be fine

This version is a new, fast and completely rewritten API, originally by Vixen, which was discontinued.
